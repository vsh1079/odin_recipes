        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups flour</li>
        <li><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teapson baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon saly</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened, or as needed, for greasing plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Toppings of choice, e.g. maple syrup or fruit, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk together. Add flour mixture to
            bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently
            stir again.</li>
        <li>Melt some butter on the griddle, the carefull wipe with a paper towel. (You want just a bit of a sheen;
            don't overgrease the griddle.) Spoon batter in <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>-cup portions onto griddle. Cook
            until bubbles form on surface of batter, about 2 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> minuites.</li>
        <li>Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> minutes. Repeat
            with remaining batter. Serve immediately with butter and toppings.</li>
    </ol>
